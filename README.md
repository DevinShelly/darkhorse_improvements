Making Darkhorse more amenable to EV betting

This does two main things at the moment. First, it automatically clicks on the update button when it becomes active so that your odds are always as up to date as possible. Second, if you double click on a bet in one of the bet finder screens, it automatically opens the Browse Odds page and opens the page for that particular market so that you can quickly see which side of the market is off.

To install, you first need a browser extension that allows you to load custom Javascript. I use Custom Javascript for Chrome, https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk?hl=en. 

Then go to darkhorseodds.com and click on the CJS icon at the top. Then click the "Inject your own external scripts" button and paste in the following, including the slashes: //cdn.statically.io/gh/DevinShelly/darkhorse_improvements/main/improvements.min.js

That's it. You should be good to go.
